    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Karolis, and I am passionate about an active lifestyle. I believe that staying fit and spending time outdoors is the best way to feel energized and happy.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gym:</strong> I love working out at the gym because it helps me stay strong, focused, and disciplined. Lifting weights and doing cardio is my way of pushing myself to new limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Exploring new places on my bike is one of my favorite activities. It gives me freedom, fresh air, and a great workout at the same time!</li>
        <li><strong>Paddleboarding: </strong>There's nothing better than being on the water. Paddleboarding helps me relax, enjoy nature, and stay active all at once.</li>
        <h2>Why I Love These Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Exercise is not just about fitness for meâ€”it's a way to clear my mind, challenge myself, and enjoy life to the fullest. Whether it's lifting weights, riding my bike, or paddling on the water, I always feel stronger and happier afterward!</p>
